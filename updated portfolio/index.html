        My name is Dylan Ferragame.
         I was born in New Mexico but have lived in Arizona pretty much all of my life.
         I'm currently living in Queen Qreek with my dad and brother which can be fun when everyone isn't in thier rooms doing thier own thing. 
         My family likes reptiles more than dogs or cats because they dont require a lot of attention which sometimes we can't provide them.
         I have a tortise named Tank who lives in the backyard and eats a whole bunch and a bearded dragon who roams around inside.
         The picture on the left is me with my bearded dragon named Carly.
         I have graduated high school and tried out community college even though I still didn't know what I wanted to do.
         After I stopped community college I tried out full time work at a construction job which was a lot of work for what they paid.
         At this job I was a fabricator that cut tiles and various metals that the company needed while I was here I met some cool people who taught me how to use all the tools aside from a screwdriver a drill.
         Later I quit that job and ended up finding about a coding bootcamp from my friend Michael who is in the same class as I am.
         Hopefully I will graduate form this class and land myself a decent paying job.
